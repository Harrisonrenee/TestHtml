    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
     It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
